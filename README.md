# MusicApp

Things to Work on: 
- ViewControllers and TableViews aren't refreshing properly - need to change View for UI to refresh.
- FavoriteButton for Favorites ViewController is displaying unliked for some reason
- UI adjustments - Thinking of using 'CardSlider' Pod
- Unit Tests

Fixes: 
- CoreData working fine now
- Row Repetition fixed for Favorites
    * The API returns 100 rows even though only 50 actual songs are available
